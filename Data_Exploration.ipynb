       " ('So right off the bat, no, I have not tried EVERY PS Move charger there is out there as there are many, but this Nyko charger seemed the best deal for the most punch. I mean, think about it - it is one of the very FEW PS Move chargers that has 4 ports which could charge any Move controller interchangeably (as in, up to 4 motion controllers or 4 navigation controllers, or mix n\\' match). Another thing that attracted me was its look, kinda has this cool \"tube\" thing going on, and looks like it can solidly hold any of the controllers. It also uses light indicators to let you know when something is mid-charge, or done charging. Lastly but definitely not least, out of all the Move chargers available here on Amazon, it is the most affordable. I got a great deal by a great used dealer on here and am very happy with my transaction. No, I didn\\'t get an original box, but don\\'t need it.<br /><br />Anyway, so how this thing works is that you basically slide in the controller and the 2 sensors that are located on the bottom of these controllers touch the sensors at the base of these tubes, and once contact is made the charging commences. The tube itself is made of a clear plastic, and the base is black with an LED underneath (nothing crazy, a small blue thing). It has an on/off button at the front of the base, so when you are ready to charge, just hit the button, and the tubes turn red while the controller is charging. The LED light already on the controllers also blinks to let you know it is charging. Once the item is fully charged the tube goes from a red light color to a bright white (which actually looks rather cool). Once it\\'s white, you know it\\'s done, you pull the controller out, and you commence your playtime. The base itself plugs into the wall via AC plug that comes separate and plugs into the base. That\\'s pretty much it. It works well enough, looks quite pretty, and even with no controllers in it does serve as a pretty cute and decorative piece.<br /><br />So onto the complaints, which aren\\'t heavy at all but still significant enough to write about. First, the unit feels rather cheap. It\\'s very light, and feels kinda like a flimsy plastic. I wouldn\\'t want to drop this thing because it may very well break, the thing just feels too delicate to ever risk being dropped or mistreated in any way. Next, the thing seems to have a bit of confusion as to when something is actually done charging. By that I mean, you could have a controller inside and have it light red for about 10 minutes, then see it white. You pop it out and figure the job is done. If you put it right back inside (let\\'s say if you just want to use the tube as a storage space, the light will turn red again and take anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute for it to turn white again. It almost makes it seems like it has trouble reading (or is slow to read) when something is actually done charging. This isn\\'t a big deal except that it MAY cause confusion as to knowing which controller is charge and which isn\\'t. I myself own 2 nav controller and 2 motion controllers. As far as this thing \"over charging\" if the item is left in too long after indicating that is done charging, I am not exactly sure. When my controllers are done charging I simply take the controllers out. I didn\\'t want to keep the controllers inside and take the risk.<br />Aside from this little quirk, there was a strange glitchy action mine did upon the first time I used it. I would put all the controllers inside, and while it was still charging (tubes were red lighted), the lights would turn off and the base blue light would come on as if the controllers were all pulled out, even though they were all in the tubes. The base blue light only turns on when there are no controllers inserted. Basically the thing was not reading my controllers even though they were in there. I turned if off and back on again and it did it again. I had remembered then that these 2 controllers that we were playing with prior on a separate game had already been fully charged, I had just simply left them in there to sit, which I stopped doing. After a second try, everything went back to normal. I just decided to ignore this as it didn\\'t happen again. But thing DID start to work properly after a few minutes.<br />There have also been complaints that it is annoying plugging in the nav controllers, that they need to be played around with and slightly shaken or \"Jimmied\" in order for the sensor to catch notice. I DID face this issue a couple of times but honestly, the thing was so minor that I wasn\\'t even going to put this in the review. It took 2 seconds to get the thing to sit right.<br /><br />Anyway, if you\\'re on a budget and just want something quick and easy, this Nyko chargers not only looks cool but also works in a necessary way. While these little strange glitches sort of just happen out of a whim, it doesn\\'t really affect the necessity for such a cute item. If you HAVE the means, and would rather pick up a Sony brand PS Move charger (the one with only 2 port holes) I would probably recommend that one over this one only because it IS the Sony official brand, and it wouldn\\'t feel flimsy and cheap. Still, lots of Move players don\\'t want to plug in only 2 controllers and they wait to take turns from the others; this is well enough, I would suggest checking out the official brand name. I bought these because they were very cheap and affordable, as well as look good. If you\\'re on a budget, I would these above the others: but if you\\'ve got the dough, pick yourself up a Wii or something.<br /><br />So just to recap some pros and cons:<br /><br />PROS:<br />-More affordable than the other 4 port chargers<br />-Good looks<br />-Light LED charge indicators<br />-Functional, charging does not take long<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Cheap/delicate feeling plastic<br />-Random glitchy tendencies<br />-Very minor issues getting the nav controllers to sit right',\n",

       " ('I must admit that I approached this dvd with a fair degree of scrutiny, due to the fact that it was one of those \"UNAUTHORIZED\" releases. I must say, however, both my friend & myself were very pleased with this recent release. Due to the fact that it was unauthorized, I had to look very closely at exactly who was involved in the making of this dvd. With some rare footage of recordings, some performance footage, and talking heads mainly with key participants that included rock journalist Robert Christgau, producer John Simon, & musicians Garth Hudson, Mickey Jones, & Charlie Mccoy, this documentary is very informative & enjoyable. Essentially beginning with some very early footage of The Hawks, who would later become The Band, & Ronnie Hawkins from 1959 performing his hits \"Mary Lou\" & Forty Days, the dvd moves forward capturing all of the important events that charted Dylans\\' progression with The Band between 1965-1976. Both fans of Dylan, as well as of The Band, will thoroughly enjoy this dvd. The Hawks attracted Dylan\\'s attention while both were playing in Greenwich Village. Both drummer/vocalist Levon Helm & guitarist Robbie Robertson were in the electrified backup group at Dylan\\'s controversial Forest Hills, New York concert of August 28, 1965. Despite a falling out between Dylan and Helm, Dylan then hired The Hawks-with drummerdylan\\'s Mickey Jones in place of Helm-for his controversial 1965-66 world tour. This became the beginnings of a longtime collaboration for both parties . After Dylan\\'s July 29, 1966 famous motorcycle accident, the group settled near the suddenly reclusive Dylan in the Woodstock, New York, area. Shortly thereafter Helm rejoined & they began to record what would evolve into \"The Basement Tapes\". The Band also began to record their own material as well. Most of this new material was written by Roberson and Richard Manuel in a basement studio in the group\\'s house, known as \"Big Pink\". This evolved into Music From Big Pink by The Band. The Band\\'s 2nd LP was simply titled \"The Band\",& Christgau & Simon stressed the importance of the LP as the beginning of what would be known as \"Americana\" music. The dvd then carefully charts the startling new direction that Dylan\\'s music took. Evolving into John Wesley Harding, Nashville Skyline, New Morning, & Planet Waves, which was recorded with The Band. The commentary by the soft-spoken Garth Hudson, who was the Band\\'s organ player, is very interesting. Mickey Jones, the drummer for the infamous tour, spoke of how the crowds would only boo louder as the tour progressed. This only drove Dylan & The Band to play louder, which would only infuriate crowds even more. There is footage from other sources, such as Eat The Document, Don\\'t Look Back, & even Monterey Pop. But there is a substantial amount of footage of the tour, as well as some sessions never seen before, to satisfy both fans of Dylan, as well as the Band. The dvd also emphasizes the idea of how both Dylan & The Band influenced & toured with each other, especially in 1974. The dvd also strongly stresses the importance of this new \"Americana\" music which The Band introduced even more strongly with their 2nd LP. There is even time given to the importance of the very 1st bootleg LP \"Great White Wonder\". All in all, fans of Dylan and/or the Band, will find the dvd a welcome delight. The running time is 114 minutes & it flows along very well. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! SMRZ!!!',\n",

Not only is  Céleste a member of the resistance, she’s also a young woman in love. With a German officer. Yep, you read that right. While she’s fighting against the Germans, she is also in a secret relationship with one. That’s not all for the twists and turns, but I don’t want to ruin the novel.<br /><br />I have to admit that I wasn’t too familiar with this part of the war before reading this. I had heard that the German occupation of France was peaceful for the most part. This novel shows how devastating the occupation was to the individuals and families who had to endure it. I found myself cheering on  Céleste and her compatriots.<br /><br />The plot kept me engaged and I found myself rushing through to the end to find out what would happen. Every time I thought poor  Céleste wouldn’t be able to handle any more, there was yet another hurdle for her to overcome. She didn’t always make the right choice, but she was brave throughout. I admired her determination, overlooked her impetuosity (she’s only 19 at the start of the story), and wanted her to succeed even though the odds were against her. You’ll have to read for yourself to find out if she did. This story shows the true brutality of war, even on the “peaceful” fronts, and it highlights how brave people can be during such a horrific time in history.',\n",

       " (\"I do not often give a video game five stars, but this one earned it.  Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare on the PS4 is an excellent game.  You will enjoy it, as long as you know what you are buying.  The first thing you need to know, is that this is a multi-player game.  This is not a game with multi-player.  ALL MODES are essentially multi-player.    The two main sections are a co-op, base defense game that is very similar to the Mass Effect 3 multi-player.  The other section is a straight up vs. mode.    Normally I hate competitive vs. multi-player.  This game is different.  They do an excellent job keeping the playing field level.  It's difficult for one or two players to brutalize the other players, as is so common in many multi-player modes.    They did an excellent job mixing up characters.  They are diverse and enjoyable.  They are so well balanced that I do not have a favorite class yet.    This is a third person shooter which sounds violent.  However, they do it in a manner that is not gory.  This game is safe for kids and fun for adults.    PROS:    Approachable for people who have never played multi-player games.    Great graphics even if they are cartoonish.    Clean and responsive game play.    Great mix of classes.    Great character animations.    Not as violent as most multi-player games.    CONS:    No story mode.    Lacks a real solo mode.    100% reliant on centralized servers.      One final comment - like ALL PS4 multi-player games, this game requires a subscription to Play Station Plus.  If you do not have a PSP account or do not want to pay for it, buy the PS3 version.  That version is also ten dollars cheaper.\",\n",

You do have to make sure both ends of the audio patch cord (included) are pushed in completely or you will not get sound out of both earmuffs.<br /><br />The muffs fold up compactly for storage but they fight me when putting on because they want to fold up. The fit is snug and that is both good and bad. I don't have to worry about them slipping and falling off but I am constantly aware of the squeezing pressure from the muffs. When wearing glasses with wider temples it is more comfortable to rest them on the top edge of the muffs rather than under the ear cushions. There is no adjustment for fit other than raising or lowering the earmuffs from the headband. It would have been better if the headband was adjustable for width; if you have a larger than average head these might be just too tight.<br /><br />These come with foam ear cushions and are replaceable at a reasonable price. Gel filled replacements are also available although pricey. [[ASIN:B00DHVXKVA 3M Peltor Camelback Gel Sealing Rings HY80, Black]]<br />There is a metal loop on both sides of the earmuffs so you can use a something like a carabineer to hang them from a belt loop.<br /><br />While these have been designed with shooting in mind they are also great for yard work with mowers, gas trimmers, leaf blowers or with power tools.\",\n",

They are water proof and they are solid in design. They are durable and I love that these ones don't blink. They look so amazing in paper lanterns. I made a bunch for our local school carnival.<br /><br />The little eyelet at the base of the light made it easier to pull them into place. Bu just placing a piece of thin string or ribbon in the eyelet and looping it down.to pull it down into place. For being tiny lights they sure do give off enough light. I love the way they illuminate the paper Lanterns. Another idea I'm working on for Christmas is holiday bells I took some shot glass size plastic clear cups punched a small hole in the bottom and pull the light through and I have my silver bells to hang along my arch way on Christmas eve to light the way for Santa when he comes.<br /><br />These are by far the best lights I have come across to work with for crafting.

I don't remember how much detail the author gave on nootropics but it was after reading this book I began my quest to sharpen my mind and improve my overall cognitive functioning.  This book is inspiring as it is factual, in my opinion.<br /><br />Besides following the exercises clearly outlined in this book, I also began researching and eventually taking a combination of nutritional supplements called nootropics (i.e. piractem, aniracetam, etc).  They were first discovered 30+ years ago and were used to treat serious medical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ADHD.  Then after scientists began recommending them as cognitive enhancers to the public, they started to become a very popular brain supplement.<br /><br />They are a very intriguing family of supplements.  My suggestion to anyone looking to improve their brain function is to look into some type of natural brain supplement, everyone is different so do your own research like I did and decide for yourself if it's a good idea.  Besides experimenting with a few nootropics, I've been taking ginseng and ginko for years, [[ASIN:B009K30D28 Ginseng Complex Plus Royal Jelly (1000 Mg) + FREE Ginkgo Biloba Extract (30 Mg) 60 Tablets]].  They're inexpensive and effective, plain and simple.<br /><br />And of course if you haven't already, read this book which, for me, was my personal inspiration and the beginning of my journey to a better me; [[ASIN:1594480931 The Better Brain Book]].\",\n",

Great Eagle PAR38 LED  15 Watt 1260 Lumens  3 Yrs Warranty<br />2. Great Eagle PAR30 LED 10 Watt 850 Lumens  3 Yrs Warranty<br />3. Feit LED BR30 LED 13 Watts 750 lumens 5 Yrs Warranty<br />4. G7 Power Elko BR30 15 Watt 1100 Lumen 10 Yrs Warranty<br />5. Feit R40 CFL 23 Watt 1300 Lumens  - replaced by new bulbs<br />6. Feit R30 CFL 15 Watt 750 Lumens<br /><br />I have 6 recessed lighting fixtures in my kitchen so I put one of each LED bulbs in 4 of the fixtures and ran them beside 2 Feit 15 Watt 750 Lumen CFLs for reference. Below is my impression of the bulbs.<br /><br />The Great Eagle PAR38 is VERY bright.  By far the brightest, highest lumens rating, of the LEDs.  Based on the numbers provided it is also the most efficient at 105 lumens/watt.  I currently do not have it on a dimmer, which is needed because my kitchen has 9' ceilings and the bulb is too bright.  Much brighter than the Feit 1300 Lumen CFL it replaced even though it is rated for slightly fewer lumens.  It is also whiter since it's a 3000k bulb. With its increased brightness and the 3000k whiter light it is a poor match for my kitchen without a dimmer as things are just too bright.  I have dimmers so I will update the review once installed.  This bulb is the closest I have seen to a halogen and I like the clear glass compared to the frosted the others use. It has a very sophisticated and stylish look.  Over all this seems like a very well built efficient LED flood.<br /><br />The Great Eagle PAR30 at 850 lumens is similar to the PAR38 in design and is a better match for my kitchen without using a dimmer.  The 3000k light is much more comfortable at lower levels - not as overwhelmingly bright. Also a very efficient LED at 85 lumens/watt.  I liked this LED a lot.  With good color, style and efficiency this LED is a good choice.<br /><br />The Feit BR30 I boughtfrom Costco.  These are almost identical in color and light output to the Feit CFLs R30s.  The color is good being warm while still showing up colors well and the lumens seem correct.  The Feit is the only bulb of the 4 that did not have cooling fins built into the base to cool the electronics.  After being run for several hours the base is HOT to the touch.  You can pick it up by the glass but not the base.  At 57 lumens/watt it is less efficient than the Great Eagles but has good color.<br /><br />I have been buying the Feit brand CFLs for years and over all have been very unhappy with their short life span.  In less than 5 years I have replaced all the Feit CFLs in my kitchen at least twice.  Bulbs rated for 10,000 hrs, 9yrs at 3hrs per day, are lasting less than 2 years.  Even as much as CFLs have come done in price I am still losing money replacing them at this rate.  If it were not the fact that I believe in living green I would have given up.<br /><br />The G7 Power Elko BR30 is interesting.  They come with a 10 years warranty (printed on the box) which is an amazing statement and very reassuring given my experience with Feit early failures.  It also has very large cooling fins built into the base and can be handled easily after run for several hours.  However they are also noticeably more yellow.  Compared to the Feit 2700k LED and CFL they have a yellowish tint.  Side by side with the 3000k Great Eagle they seem too soft and colors are washed out.  If you only use these I am sure it would not be as noticeable.  Also even though they are rated at 1097 Lumens they are not as bright at the Feits LED or CFL which are rated at 750.  Based on the brightness compared to the Great Eagles PAR30 and PAR38 the ELKOs are not putting out there rated lumens.  The manufacture states efficiency at 73 lumens/watt but based on observation I would say it's closer to 700 lumens output which would make it 46 lumens/watt( 700/15).  Over all good construction but the light outputis disappointing when compared to the other bulbs both in color and brightness.\",\n",

It is by far my favorite ship in all the Star Wars movies, and the Lego model is a near perfect representation of the ship. Also this was the first big Star Wars Lego set I bought, which in turn brought forth a wonderful second childhood of building the toys I dreamt of as a kid. I\\'ve since purchased six other models including the mighty Death Star.<br /><br />It really deserves the highest rating, but personal feelings aside, I can\\'t. Why? Because once constructed, the model is very flimsy. I\\'ve read other reviews that bragged about how sturdy it was, and I don\\'t see it. Every time I move it around, I have to be very careful. The side hedges snap out of place quite often and have to be reattached, and the ceiling panels can come off very easily. At one point, the entire cockpit assembly came apart and I had to dig out the instruction booklet to make sure it was properly attached. Honestly, I think this is a really awesome model, but it just doesn\\'t seem sturdy enough for the rough play kids will do with it once built.<br /><br />Okay, now that I said that I can get on to the good stuff.<br /><br />This is really a fun ship to build, and it will take a while. I spent four afternoons working on it, but that\\'s mostly because I like taking my time putting these things together. I suppose an expert builder with the time could put it together in one afternoon.<br /><br />Also, as with the Lego Death Star, which I also reviewed, the detail is amazing, and every single thing featured in the movies is here, from the holographic chess table to Luke\\'s Jedi training ball (even though it`s on the opposite side of the ship). The Luke figure even has a reversible face with the blast shield so he can put on the helmet and train. The tiny details like that are the things that always amaze me about these Lego sets.<br /><br />The inside of the ship is very spacious. You could literally fit a small army of mini-figs inside. I can\\'t help but think the Lego people could have done even more with the inside, but like I said, they already included everything you could think of.<br /><br />Also the mini-fig selection is awesome. You get all the main characters in their classic \"New Hope\" outfits. Though I find the inclusion of Darth Vader a bit odd since he never set foot on the Falcon. I would have liked to see Lando instead, since it was originally his ship and he later piloted it in Han\\'s absence. They could have even put him in his generals outfit from ROTJ, but it\\'s seems as if the Lego people wanted to stick to the characters from ANH.<br /><br />A couple minor complaints before I conclude. As other reviewers have noted, the cockpit is small. With all the room inside the main body of the ship, I think they could have done more here. Same with the gun turret seats in the center of the ship. It\\'s really just a flat panel with some controls attached and can\\'t be accessed from the interior of the ship. It seems more like an after thought.<br /><br />Overall, I hope no one lets my earlier criticism bother them too much. It really is an awesome ship, but I just find it a bit difficult to keep together, and I think that should be noted. In spite of a few flaws, it\\'s still very much worth it.',\n",

Overall there isn't much clamp, it just builds up after uaing them for a long time. The ears themselves are comfortable (lined with a soft cushion) and provide AMAZING isolation!! These babies made the airplane drone sound like a gentle hum. The quality is superb if you're moving from Apple earbuds or Skullcandy's or beats--the beats really are bad quality for their price--anyway, music sounds clear and crisp and gives a bit of a soundstage effect.

This is probably the worst thing about the computer to be honest. I am getting used to it, but really there isn't a way around this thing if you use it in your lap like I do. * No touchscreen.

Google Chrome does not scale whatsoever with the 1080p screen, so everything is very small on the screen. This is easily fixed by using Firefox, which scales perfectly. I'm not really tech-savvy enough to know why it does this (without googling...). Haven't had many more scaling issues other than with chrome. *All of the ports are on the right side. Someone may have an issue with this, but I don't. *The charger is a little difficult to plug in.  Pros: *Awesome display! 1080p is really beautiful on the matte screen. Works well in the sunlight as well as indoors and in the dark. *KILLER keyboard.

I can't playSkyrim at ultra high quality with no lag whatsoever but it's good. *Huge amount of space in the hard drive.

My only gripe is that Cilan and Iris don't play a huge role and are just there in the background. Also, I was saddened that despite Reshiram and Zekrom being on the cover, they are only in the movie for 10/15 minutes.<br /><br />Oh, there was one scene I loved in the Black movie. The scene where Ash pulls off all of these ninja moves in contrast to Ash running away from the falling debris was just hilarious/badass.\",\n",

       " (\"I want to first clarify some points others have been making in the reviews on this TV. It IS indeed 120hz, the person who left that review obviously had no idea what they were talking about. I've seen people dock it stars for the lack of smart functionality. This is not a smart TV. It has a basic,navigable, and responsive menu. I have also seen docked stars for lack of ports. The site plainly lists how many ports the TV has, it's your own fault if you expected it to have more.<br /><br />I have something plugged into every port on this TV, except the USB port (I have no need).<br />Xbox 360 plugged into the Component inputs (old style 360), WD Media Player into 1 HDMI, and a future HDMI cable already run for my future Xbox One. I also have standard coax cable hooked up to this TV as well. This is all I need the TV for, which is why I went with this one vs a TV with more options since budget was an issue.<br /><br />I haven't yet tweaked with the picture settings yet, but plan to and I hope to update this review when I do.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Beautiful display. My friends have commented on it's sharpness, color, and thin bezel. Minimal glare, if any in my setup.<br />-Absolutely perfect response time. I am a very heavy gamer, and this works great for FPS and fast response games. If you plan on using this for any game console, this is your TV.<br />-Absolutely no 'soap opera' effect.<br />-Color and Blacks have been very impressive. My previous LCD LG (i think 09 model) would go to 'lit black' on dark scenes, kind of like an extremely dark grey. I would say this TV is as close to real color and contrast as you can get.<br />-Nice sized remote, not a wii type.<br />-This TV does have a physical power button on the bottom, that is kind of like a joystick you can navigate a mini menu. Cool feature.<br />-Optical out, which I also use with a Soundbar/Wireless sub-woofer.<br />-True 16:9. Fits fully on the screen, no black bars.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Wall mount issues.After having issues with this  http://fave.co/1bADEyN  popular Cheetah mount on Amazon. I ended up getting this one  http://fave.co/1bADIyz  and it went very well. The ports on this TV are basically right in the middle of the back in the TV, right where the brackets for a wall mount go across. The Xbox 360. Coax, and HDMI fit, but BARELY. They are pressed hard into their slots from the bracket of the wall mount, and take hard right angles. Terrible design for the ports, I wish they were the waterfall type.<br />-I expected the built in speakers to be a little better, but I'm being pretty picky here. I only listened for about 10 mins before I hooked up my quality Soundbar just to test.\",\n",

Eventually I plan on purchasing a second PLAY:5 to use them as a stereo pair in my bedroom, or to move into separate rooms while cleaning the house.<br /><br />In regards to the SONOS system as a whole; I had initial misgivings before making the purchase, mainly due to price and the effective locking-in to the SONOS ecosystem. I have a variety of Apple products and I'd previously been quite happy using my AppleTV with AirPlay to stream music to my main audio system, but was looking for a portable speaker to use in the bedroom and outside on the patio.<br /><br />I had been very tempted by some of the B&W AirPlay speakers, but I started looking at SONOS tech for the following reasons:<br /><br />- AirPlay from a mobile device can only stream to a single speaker. A laptop or desktop can stream to multiple destinations, but isn't as convenient as an iPhone or iPad for music control.<br />- AirPlay is very dependent on the quality of your home WiFi network. Any interruptions or glitches in the wireless connection will cause issues with the stream.<br /><br />The SONOS system sets up it's own independent WiFi network as to not be impacted by the usage of your home network. SONOS devices stream the music directly from the internet or your music library requiring only your mobile devices (Android / iOS phones and tablets) to be used for remote control.<br /><br />Setup is very easy, authorization of additional devices or controllers is done by a simple button press on an existing device.<br /><br />The core thing to be aware of is that for the SONOS devices to connect to the internet, one of them MUST have an Ethernet connection to your home network. All SONOS devices come with an Ethernet network port, and SONOS sells $50 the BRIDGE device specifically to perform this role if you don't already have another device in range of an Ethernet port.<br /><br />In my case I purchased a PLAY:5 and a CONNECT device. The PLAY:5 is in my bedroom and the CONNECT is hooked up to my home theater receiver via a digital optical connection. The CONNECT plays the part of the BRIDGE as it is connected directly to my home network so I didn't need to purchase a BRIDGE.<br /><br />I can heartily recommend the SONOS system and do so regularly to colleagues, friends, and just about anyone who'll listen.\",\n",

I usually eat 3 heavy meals a day and 3 more snack time every time I feel the urge to eat. But after a week of taking it, I already felt full after a heavy meal in the morning, and would just east light meal in the afternoon with no snack time in between because I still feel full.<br /><br />3.

This well-made mold makes ice balls about 2 1/2 inches in diameter and is made of food grade silicon, heavy enough not to bend on the way to the freezer.  Yes, it \"only\" makes four ice balls at a time, but one ball will last an hour in a glass of water and more than two in soda - perfect for drinks (though you may want to pick up some glasses with wider bases).  It\\'s really the \"fun\" stuff we\\'ve been having a ball with though.<br /><br />With the holidays coming and lots of entertaining to be done, we\\'ve  put a few mint leaves, a few pieces of fruit or twists of lemon, orange or lime into the bottom half of the mold before adding water for a pretty effect once frozen.  We\\'ve also filled  the balls with punch  ingredients (minus any carbonated beverage that you would add), before freezing.  The frozen punch will chill your punch without diluting it.  Frozen ice balls can be removed from the mold and stored in zippered plastic bags in the freezer.<br /><br />Grandma\\'s $0.02 - Great for everyday, dynamite for entertaining.

       " ('These crickets are great for supplemental feeding of Purple Martins during times when they are unable to feed on flying insects due to inclement weather (temperatures below 40 degrees, excessive rain, wind or fog, periods of excessive heat and drought). Crickets are similar to grasshoppers which are a natural part of a Martin\\'s diet.<br /><br />When the crickets arrive, place the box in the freezer overnight. Once frozen, open the box and separate numbers of them into multiple zip lock bags. This way you can take them out of the freezer one bag full at a time and allow them to thaw and reach room temperature for feeding to your Martins. When you open the shoebox size box you will find the crickets within several layers of cardboard egg crate material. The best and least messy way to remove the crickets is to lay several sheets of newspaper on a non-carpeted floor (if available) and shake the contents of the egg crate material and the box onto it. Then when you are done sorting and bagging the crickets you can simply fold up and discard of the newspaper and with it the cricket \"debris\" (food remains and feces).<br /><br />Martins must be trained to accept the crickets as food, so you need to wait until such time as they are unable to feed on flying insects and are hungry before attempting supplemental feeding for the first time. Then you can use a plastic spoon to flip crickets into the air for your Martins to \"catch\" by putting a cricket in the bowl of the spoon and holding the handle of the spoon with your dominant hand while using the index finger of your other hand to pull back on the top/tip of the bowl of the spoon slightly bending the spoon and flicking/flipping the cricket straight up and airborne near enough and within the Martins eyesight. If the Martins are perched on their housing, flip the crickets up near them so that they can see them. If they begin to fly keep flipping crickets when they are near and especially when they are flying lower to the ground. The first time I tried this the Martins had been suffering through a week of constantly cold, rainy weather in which no insects were moving. At first only two of my Martins flew to \"catch\" the crickets I sent airborne, but on the 3rd day of attempted supplemental feeding, the rest of the Martins were just so hungry that as they watched the two Martins that were flying and \"catching\" the crickets they eventually gave in to their hunger and joined in, too.<br /><br />If you plan on trying to feed Martins that are already too weak to fly you can try placing some crickets in their gourds or housing.<br /><br />Crickets, mealworms and pieces of cooked beef heart can be offered on raised feeding platforms, too. These platforms can be purchased from the Purple Martin Conservation Association (purplemartin.org) which is a non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of Purple Martins.<br /><br />If your Martins are already used to accepting crushed egg shells or [[ASIN:B00AOJOBSE crushed oyster shells]] from a platform, they will more quickly accept supplemental feeding from platforms. Martins readily eat egg shells and crushed oyster shells and also feed them to their young as a source of grit and calcium. Extra calcium is extremely important for female Martins to produce strong eggs, and also for growing babies. A Martin\\'s normal diet has plenty of protein, but they must get calcium in other ways. They will collect pieces of clam shell, fish bones, mussels, and snail shells from nearby lakes, rivers, ponds and creeks on their own, but can conserve precious energy spent in search of them when provided crushed eggs shells or crushed oyster shells. Just remember that chicken egg shells must be rinsed in cold water and then baked in a 200 degree oven for 10 minutes to kill bacteria such as salmonella before crushing them.<br /><br />NOTE: Many Martin landlords feed their birds scrambled eggs and while this may be okay in a pinch to feed to adult birds in inclementweather when their normal diet of flying insects is not available, scrambled eggs have high fat content and should not be fed regularly. Scrambled eggs are also not recommended for nestlings. Long term use of scrambled eggs will cause loose stool/diarrhea due to the high fat content. Cooked beef heart can be offered as a substitute to or alongside of mealworms and crickets, but ONLY BEEF and not pork.<br /><br />Also, mealworms and crickets can be sprinkled with calcium (in the form of crushed and powdered Calcium 600mg w/D tablets) before feeding to Martins in order to give them the calcium they need in their diet.',\n",

One of these arrived from the manufacturer one day last week and we have been having a blast with it ever since.  This well-made mold makes ice balls about 2 1/2 inches in diameter and is made of food grade silicon, heavy enough not to bend on the way to the freezer.  Yes, it \"only\" makes four ice balls at a time, but one ball will last an hour in a glass of water and more than two in soda - perfect for drinks (though you may want to pick up some glasses with wider bases).  It\\'s really the \"fun\" stuff we\\'ve been having a ball with though.<br /><br />With the holidays coming and lots of entertaining to be done, we\\'ve  put a few mint leaves, a few pieces of fruit or twists of lemon, orange or lime into the bottom half of the mold before adding water for a pretty effect once frozen.  We\\'ve also filled  the balls with punch  ingredients (minus any carbonated beverage that you would add), before freezing.  The frozen punch will chill your punch without diluting it.  Frozen ice balls can be removed from the mold and stored in zippered plastic bags in the freezer.<br /><br />Grandma\\'s $0.02 - Great for everyday, dynamite for entertaining.  You might want two of these!<br /><br />Highly recommended',\n",

       " (\"I bought the MX4500 for the occasional storm outage.  My considerations were: noise, wattage, run-time, weight, cost.  I wanted to run my well pump, two refrigerators, and a propane furnace (i.e. blower).  While I can't run everything at the same time, I was able to hook up quite a bit more by also buying a transfer switch.  I STRONGLY recommend the transfer switch for safety and a more practical use of the generator.  It allows me (or my wife) to easily hookup the generator and turn circuits on/off (upto 10 circuits for our switch) based on maximum wattage.<br /><br />Noise: after trying to sleep with the noise from the neighbor's generator running several hundred feet away, I wanted something quiter. The MX4500 is reasonable (similar to a small pushmower).  From inside the house, I am not aware of the unit running.<br /><br />Weight: I wanted something me and my wife could carry (or load in the trunk of the car) if necessary.  While it's not light, we were able to carry it together.  By storing it in the garage, my wife can easily roll it to where the transfer box plug is on the side of the house, hook it up and start it (without my help!).<br /><br />Wattage: of all circuits, my 1/2 HP well pump draws the highest wattage at a MAX of 3000W startup surge (according to the manufacturer). Once the pump is running, it only draws about 1000W.  Once the water pressure tank is filled, of course there is no draw.  With that in mind, a transfer switch allows me to easily turn the well pump on and off when I need it; e.g. to take a shower or refill the pressure tank.  While the well pump is turned on, I don't use any power hungry devices.  Beware of surge wattage - the refrigerators surge when they start, the furnace blower surges etc.  During the last outage: I ran the well pump when needed, cooked dinner in the microwave, then ran a room air conditioner with several rooms of lighting and the refrigerators.  This was the only time so far I have run the unit for an extendedperiod of time.  If I recall correctly, it ran for 7 to 8 hours on one tank.<br /><br />If noise, weight and cost were not considerations, I would have bought an 8,000 Watt generator to run everything without having to switch things on and off.  With the transfer switch already in place, I could easily do that at a future time.  Considering how rarely we lose power, the price point of this unit was just right.<br /><br />Additional comment about the transfer switch, I was a little apprehensive of installing the transfer switch on my own, but it was fairly easy.  I read the instructions carefully before hand and then took a few hours for the install.  The model is a Reliance Pro/Tran 10 circuit 30 amp switch.  (It included the cable to hookup to the generator, the outdoor connection box etc.)<br /><br />I haven't had the unit for very long and have only started it 4 or 5 times.  Each time, it started on the first or second pull.  As with most engines that sit for a long time (snowblower etc), I turn the gas valve off and let the gas run out before storing the unit.  With how infrequent I expect to use this, I also use gas stabilizer.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this generator.  It does exactly what I needed at a very reasonable cost.\",\n",

Estroven helps with my mood swings and I don't sweat at night as bad but i still do. I still have those waves of electric fire but not as intense or often with estroven. Also I had a complete hysterectomy about 7 years ago. I was taken from the operating room with one of those hormone patches. At that time they were $50 each month.

I tried black cohosh, st john's wort and various holistic herbal concoctions. It took about a week and a half before these took full effect and i've used them ever since. These are working so i'll keep buying them as they are a value price wise for me too. I was paying $17 for 28 at my local shopping mart.

We don't seem to be able to gather our stuff together in order. Sometimes, we just can't find where we placed our passports or other convenient items when we need. It is usually a distressing thing for me to keep searching for an item, unloading and reloading entire luggage only to discover that what we are looking for is hidden somewhere inside one if the bags.<br />But recently a friend told us about these packing cubes. We ordered it and used many of the 4 set pcs during our last trip. It was fun! The relief was unimaginable. We had all our stuff packed in different cubes in such a way that we can easily identify and retrieve them. Even at the airport, the guys did not have to keep running their fingers through our bags as everything was relatively easy for them to check. The trip was a breeze! My kids loved these packing cubes so much. Each three of them had their own packing cubes with their items kept separately.<br />My wife love to pack her make-up in the smallest size, her other intimate items in the smaller ones and then arrange her stuff in order using the remaining ones. The different sizes make packing different items easy. On returning from our trips, we find these packing cubes even more useful.

Unfortunately my living room has hardwood flooring and therefore it is fairly difficult to install speaker wires without creating a fair amount of clutter. I looked at a few wireless speaker kits. I definitely want good quality and thus didn't opt for an entry-level model. However, I didn't want to fork out $500 for such a kit either and thus opted for the Amphony kit which is slightly less than $200.<br /><br />At that price point I was somewhat concerned that the build quality of the kit would not meet my expectations. After receiving and unpacking the kit, I was pleasantly surprised though. While both the transmitter and wireless amplifier units are packaged in a plastic enclosure, they are by no means cheaply built. They have a comfortable feel to them. The two wireless amplifiers are extremely light and quite small. I don't mind that since I have just enough space under my rear speakers to slide them in. I like the fact that unlike other wireless kits you get 2 wireless amps. The only drawback is that you have to set the volume on each amp before using the kit. If you have a fairly modern home theater receiver like I do, however, you just have to set the volume to approximately what you need and let the auto calibration routine of the home theater receiver do the fine tuning. So overall the installation is pretty straightforward.<br /><br />The sound itself is crystal clear - no hissing or crackling whatsoever. I figure that this kit would also be ideal to put some speakers in other rooms of my house but I haven't done any extensive range testing. For what it is worth this kit works extremely well in my living room. Oh, did I mention that even though I have a fair amount of other wireless gear in the house, I haven't had any issues with interference. I guess this is because this kit works at a different frequency. I really like this kit.\",\n",

Anyways I bought it from Amazon via Paul\\'s TV for $4472+tax (Los angeles tax=8.75%). Cost me total of $4863.57 with free \"white glove\" fast delivery. Ordered on Saturday March 31st, and got it delivered on Monday April 2nd, barely just like next day delivery.    Considering myself a smart shopper, I actually did some research for the price check. All other places were $1000 or more even at my favorite Frys electronics store, but I still went to Frys electronics to see this TV in action, but Frys personnel said it hasn\\'t been put on display yet, as it\\'s been barely 3 days since they recieved this model. Anyhow I told them at Amazon it\\'s cheaper price, and they were just amazed! to see the price difference. The have to call their manager to match it up. Finally they were able to match it up but they came up with delivery fee of $75.00. I still wanted to go with it but somehow I just remembered that being a Chase freedom credit card customer, I get an additional 5% cash back on purchases made from Amazon.com for the first quarter of 2012. So I end up buying at amazon.com for bigger savings and free shipping with white glove delivery.    Next day amazon bumped up the price for this TV. Lucky enough, I saved ridiculously $1000 just in overnight. I bet you they realized that they were selling the TV for a cheaper price than any other competitors.    Let\\'s get to the point of Cons and Pros of this TV discussing some key features and comparing with my other Samsung 55inch 8000 led series of 2010 model.    Pros: It plays MKV format out of the box. Built in WiFi. Web browser.  Dedicated button for Netflix on remote. Hulu plus,YouTube with HD feature, Vudu, etc. Active 3D not like other 3D TV manufacturers which use passive technology. It\\'s 240hz and motion plus to 480Hz, with contrast Ratio of 1:10 million. DLNA certified. More speaker output power of an additional 15 Watts of Bass as compared to all other LED TV manufacturers.    Cons: It won\\'t connect to portable Hard drive via USB. It only connects to electric powered hard drive and flash memory sticks (as written in instruction manual). When watching over the air channels via HD antenna, it won\\'t give you detailed description of the TV program you are watching except the name of the program. It won\\'t give you any info of the TV episode program in advance, that what is going to come next unlike my Samsung TV does. When using DLNA networking, it won\\'t play MKV files. It only plays MKV files via when using USB port but not with portable hard drive as I said above.

They are a great set of headphones overall and will not disappoint you. http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00T56GFTA  Pros + Easily pairs up with any device. I was able to pair it with both my computer (mac air) and my iphone. Once pairing is done with all the devices, you can connect to two of them simultaneously. Although, there were certain issues when I was in a microsoft lync meeting. The microphone was connected in mono mode and hence people hear muffled voices from me.  + Looks sturdy, although it is made of plastic. It fits well for someone with a smaller head as it fits really tight so that it doesn't slip from your head (happens when you are doing a workout or so enthusiastically shaking your head for your favorite song). Prolonged usage caused a little soreness over the ears. The head band is adjustable.  + Most important - the sound quality. The first impression was not great and I decided to actually return the product. But, I experimented with more good quality audio with deep bass, techno, melody, etc... The SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT. Don't expect bass from this headphone. But it is decent enough with the sound quality that you won't repent your purchase.  + Volume - This is seriously loud even with the lowest volume level in your device as well as the headphones. BASS very low.  + Functionality with phone - It works well both with the mic and the sound. Problem occurs only when you are connected in mono mode and not stereo mode (I use this terminology as shown in my mac air for this headphone). While in mono mode, people hear your muffled voice and you hear back nothing. If you are connecting to more than two devices and one of them is your phone, connect to your phone first and then to the other device next.  + Charge - This headphone retains pretty good charge. Its been 4 days since I charged it and I use it at least for 3 hrs everyday. The iphone also shows how much charge is left on the headphones.  Cons - My biggest con with this headphone is - not only I can hear the music but also everyone sitting around me, even if they are at a distance of 15 feet. There are no sound proof systems with this headphone and thus there is lot of leakage in the audio. So it seriously becomes a speaker instead of a headphone at volumes just at two bars.  Overall, this is a good headphone if you are not looking for something too good for music listening. You will not regret your purchase and will be happy you checked out http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00T56GFTA  I hope this review was helpful!\",\n",

First of all, the outer &#34;wings&#34; are weighted (more on this in a minute) and very comfy in both directions - a nice feature when cranking a head down tight to seat it.  Second, when you remove the lanyard to use it, there is a knurled knob-like part that sticks up above the key.  Once tension rods are loose (either during removal or installation), you can give it a spin between your fingers and make fast work of the rod (the weighted wings give it a little inertia to keep it spinning).  Third, the little colored rubber nubs (supplied) are handy in TWO ways: a) by using different colors it can assist in keeping track of revolutions, and b) they're perfect for tapping near the edge for lug tuning.  The lanyard is an added bonus for keeping track of the key, either around your neck or hanging off one of the floor tom tension rods.

So while this one is not the best one on amazon, it is *really* good. Then you add the prices to comparison, and this one becomes a serious no-brainer.<br /><br />I use it mostly for watching Blu-rays, and gaming (Xbox One, 360, Wii U, PS3). So far it works great in every application I throw at it.<br /><br />Most projectors matching the specs of this one are a few hundreds dollars more. You can maybe find some with a higher lumen output, but that alone is definitely not worth paying several hundred more than this one. The value this one has for its price is unheard of. Full 1080p HD, 3D support, high lumen output, more video inputs/ports than I will ever need, HDMI 1.4a spec, low bulb replacement cost, black finish (most are white). These were all good selling points I was looking for, and coupled with the great price, pushed me to purchase this model.<br /><br />The quality of the video output is great. It can be substantially improved from its default settings by using an AV optimization DVD or something along those lines though. I can use the projector with the lights on too if necessary, but it obviously looks much worse than it does when the lights are off and windows completely covered.<br /><br />I like having a good choice of inputs in case I need to connect it to an older laptop or game console, or basically anything without HDMI. But as I have a pretty good AV receiver, I use that to manage all my various connections, so I only use the HDMI 1 input. But since it's the HDMI 1.4a spec, it can handle 3D and any gaming situation I give it. It should be at least moderately future-proof.<br /><br />One other little bonus gem (feature I didn't know existed until after I set it up) is that you can remove the Optoma logo on start-up and replace it with your own. Totally unnecessary for most people, but I thought that was awesome,so I sketched out a sweet home theater logo with our family name and custom graphics, just to (attempt) to impress visitors that use it. I'm probably the only one who will really think that's cool, but whatever.<br /><br />There aren't a lot of things I don't like about this projector, but since it's not perfect I will explain. The remote feels like very low-quality cheap made-in-China garbage. It works, so I can't complain too much, but it's one of the worst-looking and feeling remotes I've ever used. Fortunately, all I really need to for was initial setup options, and to turn it on and off. I will probably also program my AV receiver remote to work with the projector also, so I won't need to use the Optoma one at all.<br /><br />It's tricky getting all four corners perfectly in focus. When I get the top perfectly in focus, the bottom gets slightly blurry, and vice-versa.<br /><br />I also would have really liked an ethernet port or some kind of network connectivity like my TVs all have. But I can't deduct a star for lacking that feature, since for the price range I'm already getting far more than any other projectors have. I didn't want to pay double the price for slightly higher lumens and an ethernet port that certain other models offered.<br /><br />The projector isn't totally silent, but it is definitely an acceptable level of noise. You can hear the fan if you are trying to listen for it, but it's not distracting or annoying like how deafeningly loud my original Xbox 360 and PS3 were.<br /><br />The last thing I'm not thrilled about is how expensive the 3D glasses are. I have six pairs of active 3D glasses for my Samsung smart TV, so me and any family/friends/visitors can all watch in 3D at the same time. The TV included four and extra pairs are not unreasonably priced. At a hundred bucks MSRP, or even, amazon's 25% lower price, for EACH one, I definitely cannot describe them as affordable. I'd like to eventually get four, but I just don't know if I'll ever be able to justify the price since it's mostly just me and my wife watching stuff on it. I rarely go 3rd-party on electronics, but I may look into getting some cheaper glasses that don't have the Optoma name, if I can get them for half the price of Optoma's.<br /><br />Overall though, very happy with this purchase. The only thing left to see is how well the lamp holds up. I'm hoping I won't have to replace it for a long time, but fortunately, the bulb replacement cost on this one is lower than most, which is another great reason to consider this projector.\",\n",

That’s why I picked up Hallmark’s High-Flying Hero, an ornament based on this character.<br /><br />Not one of the more popular live action films from the 1990’s, it was set in the 1930’s and featured a young man who finds a rocket pack and winds up using it to defeat Nazi’s in Hollywood during the period.  Pure escapist fun, or at least that’s what I recall.  It was based on a lesser known comic book character and definitely has that superhero feel to it.<br /><br />The ornament just features Cliff in his outfit at the Rocketeer.  He’s got tan pants and an orange/brown jacket on and is wearing a helmet, so you can’t really see his face.  His jet pack is on his back with flames coming out of them, and he’s semi-prone because he’s flying off to save the day.<br /><br />Now, even though I’m not a diehard fan of the movie, seeing and buying this ornament still made me smile.  It looks just like my memory of the character, so they did a great job with the sculpt.  And it is nice to see them doing something with a relatively unknown character.  I must not be the only one because this was a limited edition ornament, and it flew off the shelves.<br /><br />Since The Rocketeer is flying here, you really have to hang this ornament to display it.  Not surprising if you look at the ornament, the ring is sticking out of the jet pack.  He looks like he's tipping slightly to one side, but I guess that just means he's turning.  And he hangs at an angle that makes him look like he is rising into the air, a detail I love.<br /><br />It’s nice to see Hallmark taking a chance with a popular but lesser known character.  Based on how popular High-Flying Hero has been, I hope they’ll do more such characters, limited edition or regular line.\",\n",

Lonely Planet really gets into a country in their guides. The don't fill their pages with glossy color photos, though a few would be nice, instead their pages are full of information.<br /><br />They have maps to everywhere you'd want to go in a country. They do the cities justice as well as the countryside. They do the markets and the beaches, the churches and the museums, the bike trails and the footpaths.<br /><br />I believe a trip to Thailand should include a side tour to Vietnam, at least mine is going to, so both books are a necessity to me. The book on Thailand is over 800 pages and its writers write as if they've lived there, as if they really know the country. A different group of writers have written the Vietnam book and that surprised me, because I though some of them would have worked on both books. Nevertheless, though it's 250 pages shorter than the Thailand book, the book on Vietnam is equally as well written.<br /><br />I should say that the print in these books is on the smallish side, but I suppose to make it any larger they'd have to have so many pagers that the books would be unwieldy, especially the Thailand book.<br /><br />I've always looked at Lonely Planet as catering to a different kind of clientele than Frommor's or Fodor's. Those two companies seem to cater more toward the traveler who has more to spend, who will more than likely stay in the more expensive hotels. Sure you'll find the expensive hotels in Lonely Planet as well, but you'll find a myriad of less expensive alternatives. I believe you get more information about a country from Lonely Planet and I'm looking forward to going to Thailand and Vietnam and having Lonely Planet show me the way.\",\n",

This is an issue in part because I like it at a below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear it).<br /><br />I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using [[ASIN:B0007NIRUU Nexxus Humectress Conditioner]] for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible.<br /><br />I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula [[ASIN:B0007NIRUU Nexxus Humectress]] conditioner and [[ASIN:B00AE07FUE Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo]] (which had a scent I didn\\'t like and led to a strange incident covered in that review).  I replaced the shampoo with [[ASIN:B003V2P32Y Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo]] which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner.<br /><br />I\\'ve tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable.  Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me.<br /><br />With my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It\\'s not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me.<br /><br />Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I\\'m slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance.<br /><br />The bottom line is using [[ASIN:B003V2P32Y Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo]] and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable.<br /><br />I\\'ll update the review with observations about the \"strengthening\" properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer.<br /><br />First impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner.<br /><br />Update: Jan 9 2014<br />Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I\\'m now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice.<br /><br />What I\\'m using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it\\'s like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better.<br /><br />Update: Feb 15 2015<br /><br />I think I\\'m using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can risse this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. Whatever the case I got the same positive result.<br /><br />Matrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation even more now.',\n",

To my ears it\\'s slightly warm but with a good sense of air, not rolled-off.  * very good off-axis rejection, this mic has practically eliminated feedback issues for us without resorting to hard gating like I had to with the 58\\'s.

       " ('I purchased the str-dn1030 Sony A/V receiver to replace an old school Panasonic Receiver I\\'ve owned for over a decade. I have a TiVo HD and PS3 Slim input into the str-dn1030 via HDMI. The str-dn1030 outputs to a wall hung 42\" Panasonic Plasma via HDMI. I have internet connected to it via Ethernet. I operate my A/V system with a Harmony 900 (fully RF).<br /><br />The str-dn1030 connected to a 5.1 system and the automatic speaker calibration feature (via the included mic) was very smooth and easy. I really enjoy the sound quality of this unit. The music and sound effects from the opening bank robbery sequence in The Dark Knight (on Bluray) were simply lovely.<br /><br />Video is beautiful.<br /><br />The GUI on the str-dn1030 is almost laughably bad looking and unintuitive, but is perfectly functional with the assistance of the user manual. I am truly perplexed at how bad the GUI is given how Sony can clearly deliver a better product. Perhaps this will be improved in a future firmware update. All this being said, I find the str-dn1030\\'s bad GUI is better than the no GUI on my old Panasonic Receiver.<br /><br />The delay in getting an image from the PS3 or TiVo to my Panny 42\" display upon initially powering on the unit, or when switching inputs, was initially jarring for me. It isn\\'t ridiculously long, but definitely noticeable compared to the near instantaneous sound and signal transmission I had enjoyed with my video outputs going directly to the display (via HDMI) and my audio outputs going directly to my old receiver (via Optical).<br /><br />FYI, an inactivity power off feature appeared to have been enabled by default at the factory with my unit. I thought I was initially going crazy when watching Netflix Instant streaming when the str-dn1030 \"spontaneously\" powered off on my several times in a row. Sure enough the unit was set to power off automatically after a period of inactivity (10 minutes if I recall correctly).<br /><br />I love the str-dn1030\\'s bluetoothaudio streaming function. Especially where the str-dn1030 fires up instantly from standby as soon as you \"connect\" a paired device via bluetooth. I discovered another tricky spot with the user manual. The glossary refers you to page 101 for Bluetooth Pairing...don\\'t fall for it! Go to page 82 instead.<br /><br />I think the build quality of the unit is very good and overall I\\'m very pleased with the daily functioning of this device.',\n",

       " ('I was waiting for this 2012 model TV since I saw it at CES expo, because this 80 inch is the largest 240hz 3d TV so far. I didn\\'t expected this TV to release in March, 2012.    Anyways I bought it from Amazon via Paul\\'s TV for $4472+tax (Los angeles tax=8.75%). Cost me total of $4863.57 with free \"white glove\" fast delivery. Ordered on Saturday March 31st, and got it delivered on Monday April 2nd, barely just like next day delivery.    Considering myself a smart shopper, I actually did some research for the price check. All other places were $1000 or more even at my favorite Frys electronics store, but I still went to Frys electronics to see this TV in action, but Frys personnel said it hasn\\'t been put on display yet, as it\\'s been barely 3 days since they recieved this model. Anyhow I told them at Amazon it\\'s cheaper price, and they were just amazed! to see the price difference. The have to call their manager to match it up. Finally they were able to match it up but they came up with delivery fee of $75.00. I still wanted to go with it but somehow I just remembered that being a Chase freedom credit card customer, I get an additional 5% cash back on purchases made from Amazon.com for the first quarter of 2012. So I end up buying at amazon.com for bigger savings and free shipping with white glove delivery.    Next day amazon bumped up the price for this TV. Lucky enough, I saved ridiculously $1000 just in overnight. I bet you they realized that they were selling the TV for a cheaper price than any other competitors.    Let\\'s get to the point of Cons and Pros of this TV discussing some key features and comparing with my other Samsung 55inch 8000 led series of 2010 model.    Pros: It plays MKV format out of the box. Built in WiFi. Web browser.  Dedicated button for Netflix on remote. Hulu plus,YouTube with HD feature, Vudu, etc. Active 3D not like other 3D TV manufacturers which use passive technology. It\\'s 240hz and motion plus to 480Hz, with contrast Ratio of 1:10 million. DLNA certified. More speaker output power of an additional 15 Watts of Bass as compared to all other LED TV manufacturers.    Cons: It won\\'t connect to portable Hard drive via USB. It only connects to electric powered hard drive and flash memory sticks (as written in instruction manual). When watching over the air channels via HD antenna, it won\\'t give you detailed description of the TV program you are watching except the name of the program. It won\\'t give you any info of the TV episode program in advance, that what is going to come next unlike my Samsung TV does. When using DLNA networking, it won\\'t play MKV files. It only plays MKV files via when using USB port but not with portable hard drive as I said above.

The author uses real-life examples, cases, and scientific and psychological experiments to demonstrate just how susceptible our justice system is to human fallibility.  In one of the early chapters, for example, he uses the tragic case of David Rosenbaum, the award-winning New York Times journalist, to highlight how one mistaken assumption (that David was passed out because he was drunk - not because he had been struck and mugged, which was the reality) led to a series of oversights by police and medical professionals.  Once the mistake was realized, it was too late, and David died from head injuries.  However, as soon as his identify was known, as a respected and well -known writer, the biases swung in his favor - the perpetrator was identified, convicted and sentenced harshly.  Reforms to emergency and police procedures were passed in D.C., certainly tied to the victim's prominent and respected social standing.<br /><br />The book goes on to make sense of the seemingly irrational nature of false confessions; present the actual differences in &#34;normal&#34; and criminal brains; expose the predictability of cheating - from students to prosecutors; explore the unreliable nature of memory; discuss the obvious but oft overlooked fact that judges are humans, too! And the list goes on.<br /><br />I've never written a book review, but I felt compelled to do so for this book.  It is not only fascinating, but an extremely important subject that affects us all.  By educating ourselves about the science that dictates our every single thought and action, we can better understand how our justice system should be designed to ensure it can actually serve its purpose.  The book presents a number of easy first steps - some already being implemented - that can minimize the affect our biases have on the justice system - and also digs deeper, pushing the reader to grapple with the very nature of criminal behavior and how we as a society have been taught to view it.  I would highly recommend this interesting, enjoyable and important book.\",\n",

One of these arrived from the manufacturer one day last week and we have been having a blast with it ever since.  This well-made mold makes ice balls about 2 1/2 inches in diameter and is made of food grade silicon, heavy enough not to bend on the way to the freezer.  Yes, it \"only\" makes four ice balls at a time, but one ball will last an hour in a glass of water and more than two in soda - perfect for drinks (though you may want to pick up some glasses with wider bases).  It\\'s really the \"fun\" stuff we\\'ve been having a ball with though.<br /><br />With the holidays coming and lots of entertaining to be done, we\\'ve  put a few mint leaves, a few pieces of fruit or twists of lemon, orange or lime into the bottom half of the mold before adding water for a pretty effect once frozen.  We\\'ve also filled  the balls with punch  ingredients (minus any carbonated beverage that you would add), before freezing.  The frozen punch will chill your punch without diluting it.  Frozen ice balls can be removed from the mold and stored in zippered plastic bags in the freezer.<br /><br />Grandma\\'s $0.02 - Great for everyday, dynamite for entertaining.  You might want two of these!<br /><br />Highly recommended',\n",

The 3D quality is stunning and the picture quality for regular 2D is outstanding.  I did quite a bit of research and boiled my choices down to LG, Panasonic Plasma, and the Vizio.  The LG looked good but the price difference was too great in my opinion.  I was leaning towards the Panasonic based on my excellent experience with the set I\\'ve owned for 10 years or so.  I went to an electronics store to see both the Vizio and Panasonic 3D and that sold me on the Vizio.  The only complaint I have is the remote which is terrible.  Fortunately I have a Harmony and that works well with the Vizio.  Buy this set.  You won\\'t be sorry.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Now that I have owned this set for 3 plus months I would like to add to my initial review.  While the set is still very good in terms of viewing pleasure it has developed some bugs in the last month or so.  The first is I sometimes lose audio, generally when changing channels.  I change the channel and I hear a \"pop\" and then no audio.  I have to turn off the set and then back on to get the audio working.  I use a Samsung Soundbar connected to the TV via HDMI Arc which works very well.  The TV completely controls Power on, off, etc.  The issue is not a problem with the Soundbar as I experienced the same thing when the TV was connected to a BOSE Cinemate system.<br /><br />The second glitch, which is far more annoying, is the TV sometimes fails to power up.  I hit my Harmony remote to Power Up the TV, Soundbar, and Cable Box and the TV fails to come on.  I have tried pushing the manual button on the back of the set but no joy.  The only way to get the TV to power up is to pull the power cord, wait 10 seconds or so, and then plug it back in.  Then it powers up and plays without any issues.<br /><br />I did get an extended warranty with the set which I think I will be using in the near future.  This is my first Vizio, and while it has many great features, I fear it is not going to be very dependable over time.  We shall see.',\n",
